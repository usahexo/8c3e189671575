#  Los Angeles Players Triumph At Casino Pauma!

The Los Angeles Dodgers definitely had something to celebrate after their big win at the Casino Pauma on Monday. With a score of 6 to 2, the Dodgers players showed their skills and outplayed their opponents.

For Corey Seager, it was an especially sweet victory. This was his first game since coming back from an injury. And it seems that he didn’t lose any of his batting power during his time off the field. In the fifth inning, he blasted a ball over the fence for a three-run homer.

Other players who contributed to the victory include Cody Bellinger and Max Muncy. Muncy hit a solo homer in the seventh inning, while Bellinger smacked a double in the ninth inning.
