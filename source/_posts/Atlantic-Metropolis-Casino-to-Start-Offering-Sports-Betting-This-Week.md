#  Atlantic Metropolis Casino to Add Sports Betting Now That Supreme Court Ruling Allows It

Casinos in Atlantic City are preparing to offer sports betting, now that the US Supreme Court has struck down a federal law that had banned the activity. The decision opens the door for states to enact their own laws regulating sports betting.

Atlantic Metropolis Casino is among the first in the city to announce its plans to add sports betting. The casino, which is owned by Caesars Entertainment, said it would offer the betting within weeks of the Supreme Court’s ruling.

Other casinos are likely to follow suit. Philadelphia-based SugarHouse Casino has already announced its plans to offer sports betting and has applied for a licence from Pennsylvania gaming regulators.

The Supreme Court’s decision comes as no surprise, given that Justice Anthony Kennedy hinted last year that the law might be overturned. The court’s six conservative justices voted in favour of overturning the ban, while the three liberal justices dissented.

The ban on sports betting was enacted in 1992 as part of the federal law known as the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA). It prevented states from authorising sports gambling, although it did not stop people from engaging in the activity illegally.

Supporters of overturning PASPA argued that it hurt the economy and deprived states of revenue from taxes on gambling. They also said it created an uneven playing field for states that wanted to allow sports betting, because they were prohibited from doing so by federal law.

Opponents of overturning PASPA argued that it would lead to increased crime and addiction rates. They also said it would be difficult to regulate and could jeopardise the integrity of sport games.

Now that PASPA has been overturned, each state will have to decide how to regulate sports betting within its borders. Some states – such as New Jersey, Delaware and West Virginia – have passed laws allowing sports gambling in anticipation of Tuesday’s ruling. Other states are likely to follow suit soon.
