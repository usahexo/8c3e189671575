#  How to Get to the Wedding Chapel in Tuvalu 

The island nation of Tuvalu, located in the central Pacific Ocean, is made up of nine small islands. While the country may be small, it is packed with beautiful scenery and interesting attractions, including the wedding chapel on Funafuti Island. Here are some tips for getting to the chapel.

Funafuti Island is the capital of Tuvalu and home to the country’s only airport. The airport is serviced by Air Tuvalu, which offers flights from Fiji and Honolulu. If you are not able to fly into Funafuti Island, there are also ferry services available from Fiji and Samoa.

Once you arrive on Funafuti Island, the wedding chapel is easy to find. It is located just north of the airport near the oceanfront. If you are walking or biking, it should take you about 10 minutes to get there from the airport. If you are driving, it will take a bit longer as the roads on Funafuti are not in great condition.

The wedding chapel on Funafuti Island is a beautiful white building with a thatched roof. It was built by the Japanese government in 1960 and has been used for weddings ever since. The chapel can accommodate up to 100 guests and has a picturesque location overlooking the ocean.

If you are planning to get married in Tuvalu, be sure to include a visit to the wedding chapel on Funafuti Island on your list of things to do!

#  How Much Does It Cost to Get Married in Tuvalu?

On the surface, it may appear that getting married in Tuvalu would be a relatively inexpensive endeavor. After all, this small island country is located in the South Pacific and is considered to be one of the world's poorest nations. However, when you consider all of the associated costs, marrying in Tuvalu can be quite expensive.

The first cost you will need to consider is travel. Unless you live in the South Pacific or are able to score a ridiculously cheap airfare, getting to Tuvalu will likely be your biggest expense. Once you're there, you'll need to factor in accommodations and food costs. Even if you're lucky enough to find a place to stay that's affordable, you'll still likely spend quite a bit on food since prices for basic staples like rice and fish are high compared to other countries.

Another big expense when getting married in Tuvalu is the marriage license itself. The fee for a marriage license in Tuvalu is currently $200 USD, which is more than what you would pay in most other countries. And don't forget about gratuities! If you have a wedding planner or any other service providers helping with your wedding ceremony and reception, it's customary to tip them 10-20% of the total cost.

So how much does it actually cost to get married in Tuvalu? Assuming you're flying from North America and have a small wedding with just a few guests, we estimate that the total cost would be around $3,500 USD. This includes the cost of the marriage license, travel expenses, food and accommodation costs, and tips for service providers. Keep in mind that this amount could vary significantly depending on your specific circumstances.

If you're looking for an exotic location to get married but don't want to break the bank, Tuvalu may be a good option for you. Just be sure to factor in all of the associated costs so that you're not surprised by anything once you're there!
