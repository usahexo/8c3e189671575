#  How to Play Russian Roulette in Gambling Establishment Milosz for Fun and Profit

Russian roulette (Russian: русская рулетка, tr. russkaya rulëtka) is a lethal game of chance in which a player puts a single round from a six-round revolver revolver to his head and pulls the trigger, spinning the cylinder so that the bullet may come to any of the chambers. If it chambers another bullet, he has to put the gun to his head and spin the cylinder again. If it does not chamber a bullet, then he survives and can play again.
