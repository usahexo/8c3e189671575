But, what happened earlier in the game was even more impressive.</p>
<p>A woman named Kelly Mazzante won a blackjack game against her friends and was given a ceremonial puck from the game. What makes this story even more interesting is that Mazzante was actually a professional hockey player herself.</p>
<p>Mazzante played for Penn State University and represented the United States at various international tournaments. After playing professionally in Europe, she eventually settled down in Las Vegas and started working as a blackjack dealer.</p>
<p>It’s fair to say that Mazzante knows her way around a casino, so it came as no surprise when she won some money from her friends. However, what was really astonishing was that she did it in front of a packed house and on national TV.</p>
<p>Not only did Kelly Mazzante win some money from her friends, but she also made history by being the first woman to score an NHL point. In doing so, she has shown the world that women can compete with the best of them.</p>
<h1 id="Blackjack-Dealer-Falls-Victim-To-Women’s-Strategy"><a href="#Blackjack-Dealer-Falls-Victim-To-Women’s-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="Blackjack Dealer Falls Victim To Women’s Strategy"></a>Blackjack Dealer Falls Victim To Women’s Strategy</h1><p>In the casino game of blackjack, the dealer is at a disadvantage when it comes to winning against players. This fact has been exploited by some clever women who have developed a strategy that can potentially lead to the dealer’s downfall.</p>
<p>The starting point of this strategy is to observe how the dealer deals the cards. If they tend to deal cards one at a time from the top of the deck, then you can be almost certain that they are using what is called a “striking” method. In this instance, the dealer will usually start with their strongest hand and work their way down, meaning that they are less likely to bust. Conversely, if the dealer deals cards two at a time or more from the bottom of the deck, then they are using a “mechanical” dealing method which makes them more likely to bust.</p>
<p>Once you have identified how the dealer is dealing cards, you need to determine your own strategy accordingly. For example, if you know that the dealer is using a striking method, then you should increase your bet size in order to capitalize on their probable decision making. Alternatively, if you know that the dealer is using a mechanical method, then you should decrease your bet size as they are more likely to make mistakes.</p>
<p>Whilst there is no guaranteed way to win against a blackjack dealer, employing this strategy can give you an edge over them. So next time you’re playing blackjack in a casino, be sure to keep an eye on how the dealer is dealing cards and use this information to your advantage!</p>
<h1 id="Pair-of-Blackjack-Ladies-Win-Big-in-NHL-Debut"><a href="#Pair-of-Blackjack-Ladies-Win-Big-in-NHL-Debut" class="headerlink" title="Pair of Blackjack Ladies Win Big in NHL Debut"></a>Pair of Blackjack Ladies Win Big in NHL Debut</h1><p>In what is being called one of the most improbable upsets in sports history, a pair of blackjack dealers turned professional hockey players scored a stunning victory over the Montreal Canadiens on their debut game.</p>
<p>Michelle and Debora, who requested their last names not be published, were given no chance by pundits of winning against the highly-rated Canadiens. But the underdogs dominated from start to finish, culminating in a 5-2 victory that has everyone wondering if they can do it again.</p>
<p>“I still can’t believe it,” said Michelle after the game. “We knew we had what it takes to win, but we never thought it would actually happen.”</p>
<p>The unlikely duo first met several years ago when they were both working at a casino in Las Vegas. They became fast friends and discovered they shared a love for hockey. When Michelle was offered a spot on an amateur team in Calgary, she contacted Debora and begged her to come play with her.</p>
<p>At first Debora was reluctant, but after some convincing she agreed to give it a try. The two of them spent months practicing together and soon developed into a formidable team. So when an opportunity came up for them to play professionally in the NHL, they grabbed it with both hands.</p>
<p>Their impressive debut has left many people wondering if this could be the beginning of a new era in hockey – one where blackjack dealers dominate the ice instead of skilled athletes. Only time will tell, but for now Debora and Michelle are just enjoying their moment in the sun.</p>
<h1 id="Women’s-Strategy-Pays-Off-in-NHL-Debut-Blackjack-Game"><a href="#Women’s-Strategy-Pays-Off-in-NHL-Debut-Blackjack-Game" class="headerlink" title="Women’s Strategy Pays Off in NHL Debut Blackjack Game"></a>Women’s Strategy Pays Off in NHL Debut Blackjack Game</h1><p>In the NHL debut blackjack game, women’s strategy paid off. The women, who made up just over one-third of the players in the game, won more money on average than the men playing in the game. This is despite the fact that when the cards are dealt, men are typically dealt better hands.</p>
<p>The women’s strategy was simple: stay conservative and avoid risk. They didn’t take unnecessary chances, such as splitting pairs or doubling down on weak hands. Instead, they let the cards play out and took whatever money they could get at the end of the hand. This basic strategy paid off big time against their male counterparts.</p>
<p>The overall winning percentage for the women players was 53%, while for the men it was only 49%. This may seem like a small difference, but when you’re talking about large pots of money, it can add up quickly. In total, the women players walked away with an extra $1,500 in winnings, while the men only took home an extra $1,000.</p>
<p>There are a few different reasons why women’s strategy may have worked better in this particular game. One possibility is that women are typically more patient than men when it comes to gambling games. They’re more likely to wait for a good hand instead of trying to force things and make risky plays. Women may also be better at reading other players and guessing what they might do next. This can help them to make smarter decisions about their own gameplay.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, it’s clear that using a conservative strategy pays off sometimes - especially when playing against men!</p>
<h1 id="Pair-of-Women-Win-Blackjack-Tournament-in-NHL-Debut"><a href="#Pair-of-Women-Win-Blackjack-Tournament-in-NHL-Debut" class="headerlink" title="Pair of Women Win Blackjack Tournament in NHL Debut"></a>Pair of Women Win Blackjack Tournament in NHL Debut</h1><p>Last night in Las Vegas, a pair of women made history by becoming the first-ever female blackjack players to win a tournament at an NHL game. The contest, which was part of the pre-game festivities for the Vegas Golden Knights’ home opener against the Arizona Coyotes, was open to anyone who wanted to play. But it was the women, clad in matching black Golden Knights jerseys, who took home the top prize.</p>
<p>Asked what it felt like to win, one of the women said simply, “unbelievable.” Another added, “We just can’t believe it. We’re so excited!”</p>
<p>The two sisters, Kelly and Lauren Kunkel from Gilbert, Arizona, were among the 123 contestants in the tournament. They beat out stiff competition including several professional gamblers and even a few former pro athletes. When their victory was announced on the jumbotron at T-Mobile Arena, they received a standing ovation from the crowd.</p>
<p>This wasn’t the Kunkels’ first foray into competitive blackjack; they regularly play in tournaments around the country. But last night’s victory was undoubtedly their biggest yet.</p>
<p>In addition to winning a $10,000 prize pool, Kelly and Lauren Kunkel walked away with some priceless bragging rights. And they showed that there is no gender barrier when it comes to blackjack – or winning big in Las Vegas.</p>
