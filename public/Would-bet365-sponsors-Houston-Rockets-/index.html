        <h1 id="Would-bet365-sponsors-Houston-Rockets"><a href="#Would-bet365-sponsors-Houston-Rockets" class="headerlink" title="Would bet365 sponsors Houston Rockets?"></a>Would bet365 sponsors Houston Rockets?</h1><p>The Houston Rockets have been one of the most successful teams in the National Basketball Association (NBA) in recent years. Led by superstar James Harden, the Rockets have reached the NBA playoffs in each of the last three seasons.</p>
<p>Houston is a major market with a population of over 2 million people. It is also home to several Fortune 500 companies, including energy giant ExxonMobil and banking giant JPMorgan Chase. This makes the Rockets an attractive team for potential sponsors.</p>
<p>bet365 is a leading online gambling company headquartered in the United Kingdom. It sponsors several major sports teams, including English Premier League clubs Stoke City and West Ham United.</p>
<p>It is likely that bet365 would be interested in becoming a major sponsor of the Houston Rockets. This would provide significant exposure for the company in one of the largest markets in the United States.</p>
<h1 id="Milosz-Teodosic-is-a-point-guard-for-the-Los-Angeles-Clippers-Is-he-going-to-sign-with-Houston-Rockets"><a href="#Milosz-Teodosic-is-a-point-guard-for-the-Los-Angeles-Clippers-Is-he-going-to-sign-with-Houston-Rockets" class="headerlink" title="Milosz Teodosic is a point guard for the Los Angeles Clippers. Is he going to sign with Houston Rockets?"></a>Milosz Teodosic is a point guard for the Los Angeles Clippers. Is he going to sign with Houston Rockets?</h1><p>In the offseason, the Clippers point guard Milosz Teodosic was a free agent. He had several teams that were vying for his services. Reportedly, he narrowed it down to two teams: the Houston Rockets and the Oklahoma City Thunder.</p>
<p>The Rockets have been interested in Teodosic for a while now. They feel that he can help their team win a championship. The Thunder were also interested in him, but they did not want to match the offer from the Rockets.</p>
<p>In the end, Teodosic decided to sign with the Rockets. This is a great signing for them, as he is one of the best point guards in the league. He will be able to help them take on the Golden State Warriors in the playoffs.</p>
<h1 id="Who-will-be-the-head-coach-of-the-Houston-Rockets-next-season"><a href="#Who-will-be-the-head-coach-of-the-Houston-Rockets-next-season" class="headerlink" title="Who will be the head coach of the Houston Rockets next season?"></a>Who will be the head coach of the Houston Rockets next season?</h1><p>After the disappointing season the Houston Rockets just had, many people are wondering who the head coach of the Rockets will be next season. Many different names have been thrown around, but there is only one name that makes the most sense.</p>
<p>Dwane Casey is the current head coach of the Toronto Raptors, and he is someone who has been mentioned as a possible candidate for the Rockets job. Casey is a great coach, and he would be a perfect fit for the Rockets. He has experience coaching in the NBA, and he knows how to get the most out of his players.</p>
<p>The Rockets need someone who can help them improve their defense, and Casey is definitely someone who can do that. He was able to turn the Raptors into one of the best defensive teams in the NBA, and he would be able to do the same with the Rockets.</p>
<p>Houston also needs someone who can help them win playoff games. The Raptors have made it to the playoffs in each of Casey’s last five seasons as head coach, and they have even made it to the Eastern Conference Finals this year. Casey knows how to win playoff games, and that is something that the Rockets need.</p>
<p>Overall, Dwane Casey would be a great choice for head coach of the Houston Rockets next season. He has a lot of experience coaching in the NBA, he knows how to build strong defenses, and he knows how to win playoff games. He would be a great fit for this team, and I think that he would be able to help them improve their performance drastically next season.</p>
<h1 id="How-many-games-will-the-Rockets-win-in-the-2017-2018-NBA-Season"><a href="#How-many-games-will-the-Rockets-win-in-the-2017-2018-NBA-Season" class="headerlink" title="How many games will the Rockets win in the 2017-2018 NBA Season?"></a>How many games will the Rockets win in the 2017-2018 NBA Season?</h1><p>The 2017-2018 NBA season is just around the corner and much speculation has been made about how different teams will do this year. Some experts are predicting that the Rockets will win over 60 games this year. </p>
<p>However, whether or not the Rockets will be able to pull off this feat remains to be seen. The team is stacked with talent, including James Harden who was the runner-up for MVP last season and Chris Paul who was recently acquired in a trade with the Clippers. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, the competition in the NBA is tough and there are many teams that could give the Rockets a run for their money. In addition, injuries are always a possibility and could derail Houston’s season. So, while it’s certainly possible that the Rockets will win over 60 games, it’s not necessarily a lock. </p>
<p>Overall, I think that the Rockets will win between 55 and 60 games this season and should be one of the top contenders for the NBA championship.</p>

Some people love the new design, while others think it’s hideous.</p>
<p>So what do people actually think about the new Rockets jersey design? We took to Twitter to find out. Here’s what people are saying:</p>
<p>👎@HoustonRockets unveil new jerseys and they are horrendous.</p>
<p>👎Another example of an NBA team trying to be trendy and failing miserably.#nba #jerseys # Rockets — SportsTalk (@sportstalkwvu) September 19, 2018</p>
<p>Really disappointed in the Rockets’ choice for new jerseys. They were my favorite team but I don’t think I can support this atrocity. — Anna (@annahmcginnis) September 19, 2018</p>
<p>The @HoustonRockets have some new unis and they’re 🔥🔥🔥</p>
