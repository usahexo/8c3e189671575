        <h1 id="Dodgers’-Clayton-Kershaw-Wins-Another-1-0-Game-in-Dominant-Fashion"><a href="#Dodgers’-Clayton-Kershaw-Wins-Another-1-0-Game-in-Dominant-Fashion" class="headerlink" title="Dodgers’ Clayton Kershaw Wins Another 1-0 Game in Dominant Fashion"></a>Dodgers’ Clayton Kershaw Wins Another 1-0 Game in Dominant Fashion</h1><h1 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw delivered yet another dominant pitching performance on Tuesday night, leading his team to a 1-0 victory over the Miami Marlins. Kershaw allowed just four hits and no walks while striking out 12 batters, making him the first pitcher in over a century to boast seven consecutive games with at least 10 strikeouts. This was also the fourth time this season that Kershaw has pitched a complete game shutout.</p>
<p>The Dodgers offense provided all of the scoring in this contest, getting on the board in the top of the fourth inning when Justin Turner drove in Enrique Hernandez with a single. That would be all the support that Kershaw would need, as he cruised to yet another impressive win.</p>
<p>Kershaw’s latest outing was yet another reminder of just how good he is, as he continues to stake his claim as one of the best pitchers in baseball history. With 240 career wins and counting, Kershaw is well on his way to achieving Hall of Fame-level success.</p>
<h1 id="Red-Sox-Star-David-Ortiz-Hits-453rd-Career-Home-Run"><a href="#Red-Sox-Star-David-Ortiz-Hits-453rd-Career-Home-Run" class="headerlink" title="Red Sox Star David Ortiz Hits 453rd Career Home Run"></a>Red Sox Star David Ortiz Hits 453rd Career Home Run</h1><p>A milestone home run for Boston Red Sox slugger David Ortiz. With his 453rd career home run on September 12th, 2016, Ortiz became the 27th member of the exclusive 500 home run club.</p>
<p>Ortiz has played his entire MLB career with the Red Sox, and has been one of the most consistent hitters in the game for over a decade. His milestone homer was a two-run shot off Toronto Blue Jays starter Marco Estrada in the bottom of the fourth inning, which gave Boston a 2-0 lead. The Red Sox would go on to win the game 4-2.</p>
<p>“It’s an honor,” Ortiz said after the game about joining the 500 home run club. “It’s something that you don’t achieve by yourself. You need help from your teammates and your family.”</p>
<p>In addition to his 500 homers, Ortiz also ranks among the all-time leaders in hits (2,472) and RBIs (1,569) for a designated hitter. He is one of just seven players in MLB history with at least 500 homers and 1,500 RBIs.</p>
<p>The Dominican-born Ortiz is one of the most popular players in baseball, and is known for his charismatic personality and big bat. He is sure to be inducted into the Hall of Fame when he retires at the end of this season.</p>
<h1 id="Orioles’-Chris-Davis-Sets-Record-with-108-RBIs"><a href="#Orioles’-Chris-Davis-Sets-Record-with-108-RBIs" class="headerlink" title="Orioles’ Chris Davis Sets Record with 108 RBIs"></a>Orioles’ Chris Davis Sets Record with 108 RBIs</h1><p>In a season that has seen many players set new records, Orioles first baseman Chris Davis has added his name to the list. With 108 RBIs, Davis has set a new record for most RBIs in a season.</p>
<p>This record-setting season is just the latest chapter in Davis’ storybook career. He was drafted by the Rangers in 2005 and made his major league debut in 2008. After playing for three teams over six seasons, Davis signed with the Orioles prior to the 2012 season.</p>
<p>Since joining the Orioles, Davis has become one of the best hitters in baseball. He led the American League in home runs in 2013 and 2014, and now he has topped that by setting a new RBI record.</p>
<p>Davis is not only one of the best hitters in baseball, but he is also one of the most durable players in the game. He has played more than 150 games each of the past four seasons, and he shows no signs of slowing down.</p>
<p>With Davis leading the way, the Orioles are poised to make a run at their first World Series title since 1983.</p>
<h1 id="Royals-Win-10th-Straight-Playoff-Game"><a href="#Royals-Win-10th-Straight-Playoff-Game" class="headerlink" title="Royals Win 10th Straight Playoff Game"></a>Royals Win 10th Straight Playoff Game</h1><p>Kansas City picked up their tenth consecutive playoff victory on Tuesday night with a 2-1 win over the Astros in Houston. The Royals, who were down 1-0 in the sixth inning, rallied back with two runs to take home the win and move on to the American League Championship Series.</p>
<p>Houston starting pitcher Dallas Keuchel was dominant early on, striking out six batters in 4.2 innings pitched. However, the Astros bullpen was unable to hold onto the lead as Royals’ designated hitter Kendrys Morales hit a two-run homer in the sixth inning to give Kansas City the lead.</p>
<p>Royals’ starting pitcher Edinson Volquez pitched well in his 5.2 innings of work, allowing only one run while striking out five Astros hitters. The Royals bullpen then took over and shut down the Astros for the last three innings, securing the team’s tenth consecutive playoff victory.</p>
<p>The Royals will now face off against Toronto in the ALCS. The Blue Jays swept their three-game series against Texas to advance to their first ALCS since 1993.</p>
<h1 id="Mets-Sweep-Cubs-in-Thrilling-NLCS"><a href="#Mets-Sweep-Cubs-in-Thrilling-NLCS" class="headerlink" title="Mets Sweep Cubs in Thrilling NLCS"></a>Mets Sweep Cubs in Thrilling NLCS</h1><p>After dropping the first two games of the National League Championship Series, the Mets mounted a stunning comeback, sweeping the heavily favored Cubs in four games. The series finale was a back-and-forth thriller, with the Mets rallying from a 5-2 deficit to win 9-8 in 13 innings.</p>
<p>The Cubs jumped out to an early lead, scoring twice in the top of the first inning. But the Mets stormed back in the bottom of the frame, scoring three runs to take the lead. The Cubs regained the advantage with two more runs in the top of the third inning, but again the Mets came back, scoring four runs in the bottom of the inning to take a 7-5 lead.</p>
<p>The Cubs tied it up with three runs in the top of the sixth inning, and after neither team could score again for six innings, Chicago took an 8-7 lead in the top of thirteenth on a solo home run by Javier Baez.</p>
<p>But New York would not be denied. With two outs and runners on first and second base, pinch hitter T.J. Rivera hit a game-tying RBI single. Then Wilmer Flores hit a sacrifice fly to give New York a 9-8 lead. Jeurys Familia closed things out in the bottom of the inning to clinch New York’s first trip to the World Series since 2000.</p>
<p>The epic comeback was fueled by excellent pitching performances throughout the series by Mets starters Matt Harvey, Jacob deGrom, Noah Syndergaard and Steven Matz. In addition, key contributions came from Daniel Murphy – who batted .529 for the series – and Curtis Granderson, who hit two home runs in Game Four.</p>
<p>The Mets will now face either Toronto or Kansas City in the World Series. The Blue Jays currently lead that series 3-2, but Game Six is scheduled for tonight and anything can happen in baseball’s ultimate showdown.</p>
