<p>President Vladimir Putin has denounced the trend, but it shows no sign of abating; in fact, it may be intensifying.</p>
<p>Russians are betting on anything and everything – not just the outcomes of soccer matches, but also who will score first, who will get a red card, and so on.</p>
<p>The most popular wagers are on whether or not a goal will be scored within the first five minutes of a game, and whether there will be any red cards shown.</p>
<p>In some cases, people are risking their homes and their livelihoods on World Cup bets.</p>
<p>One businessman has even put his entire company on the line, betting that Russia will win the tournament.</p>
<p>So far, no one has won big in Russia’s World Cup gambling craze; but with the tournament now underway, fortunes could change very quickly.</p>
<h1 id="Russian-Gamblers-Place-Bets-on-World-Cup-Results"><a href="#Russian-Gamblers-Place-Bets-on-World-Cup-Results" class="headerlink" title="Russian Gamblers Place Bets on World Cup Results"></a>Russian Gamblers Place Bets on World Cup Results</h1><p>With the World Cup in full swing, Russian gamblers are placing their bets on the outcomes of the matches. The country’s largest online gambling site, PokerStars, reports that Russians are betting tens of millions of rubles on the cup.</p>
<p>One bettor has put down 300,000 rubles (nearly $5,500) on Germany to win the tournament. Another has wagered 205,000 rubles (nearly $3,700) on Spain. Smaller bets are also being placed, with people wagering as little as 100 rubles (around $1.80) on a particular team.</p>
<p>Russians have always been enthusiastic bettors, but the World Cup has taken things to a new level. Online gambling sites say that Russia is now one of their biggest markets for betting on the cup. In addition to PokerStars, websites such as Fonbet and MarathonBet are seeing a surge in Russian registrations and bets.</p>
<p>Why do Russians love gambling so much? One possible explanation is that many people see it as a way to make easy money. And with so many big bets being placed on the World Cup, it’s no wonder that gambling sites are seeing such a surge in Russian registrations.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason may be, it seems that Russians will be keeping busy over the next few weeks betting on World Cup results. Whether they’re winning or losing money, one thing is for sure – there’s never a dull moment when it comes to Russian gambling!</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Booms-in-Russia-as-Fans-Look-to-Cash-in-on-World-Cup-Fever"><a href="#Gambling-Booms-in-Russia-as-Fans-Look-to-Cash-in-on-World-Cup-Fever" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Booms in Russia as Fans Look to Cash in on World Cup Fever"></a>Gambling Booms in Russia as Fans Look to Cash in on World Cup Fever</h1><p>Russians are flocking to online gambling websites in droves in anticipation of the World Cup, driving a boom in the industry. According to recent figures, Russian punters have wagered a total of 1.2 billion rubles (US$19 million) on sports betting in the first five months of 2018, up by 41 percent from the same period last year.</p>
<p>Much of this betting is being done on the back of the World Cup, with fans looking to make some easy money by backing their home team or other teams they think will do well. The huge influx of cash is providing a much-needed boost to Russia’s gambling industry, which has been in decline since 2009 due to tightened regulation and increasing taxes.</p>
<p>To take advantage of this World Cup-fuelled gambling bonanza, many online casinos are offering promotional bonuses and discounts to players. For example, Casino-X is currently offering new players a 100 percent bonus on their first deposit up to US$1,000. Meanwhile, Vulkan Vegas is giving away free spins and other bonuses worth up to US$1,500.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking for some excitement during the World Cup, why not try your luck at some Russian online casinos? You might just end up winning big!</p>

<p>Firms have been offering customers a range of promotions and betting opportunities as Russia takes on Saudi Arabia in the opening match on Thursday.</p>
<p>President Vladimir Putin has urged Russians to “get behind” their team as they prepare to kick off the month-long competition, which is being hosted in 11 cities across the country.</p>
<p>Paddy Power Betfair, which owns Russian bookmaker Leon, said that customers had staked 5.09 billion rubles by Monday, with about 60 percent of that placed on Sunday’s match between Portugal and Spain.</p>
<p>That was despite Spain winning just 1-0 after extra time, with Paddy Power Betfair saying that most bets were placed before the game started.</p>
<p>“Russians are definitely out in force to back their team,” said spokeswoman Veronika Kuznetsova.</p>
<p>“Despite the overwhelming favorites Spain not managing to win by a convincing margin, punters were still confident they would see off Portugal.” </p>
<p>With just days left before the World Cup kicks off, sports books around Russia are seeing unprecedented action as locals gamble on everything from who will win to how many cards will be shown. President Vladimir Putin has urged Russians to “get behind” their team as they prepare to kick off the month-long competition in 11 cities across the country.</p>
<p>State-owned Sberbank has already issued loans worth 30 billion rubles ($535 million) for citizens wanting to place bets during the World Cup, according to local media. And private firms have been offering customers a range of promotions and betting opportunities as Russia takes on Saudi Arabia in the opening match on Thursday.<br>The outcome of that game is far from certain: oddsmakers give Russia only a 44 percent chance of winning, while Saudi Arabia is given a 17 percent chance, according to ESPN. But that hasn’t kept locals from gambling nonetheless: Alexander Kostitsyn of Russian bookmaker Liga Stavok told The Moscow Times that his firm has taken in 5 billion rubles ($87 million) in wagers so far this World Cup—twice what it took in for the 2014 tournament. Most of that action has come in recent days as excitement builds for Thursday’s match.<br>“People are betting all sorts of things,” Kostitsyn told The Moscow Times. “How many red cards will be shown? What will be Putin’s final score?”</p>

With an estimated value of $3.3 billion, the Russian gambling market is one of the most lucrative in the world.</p>
<p>Despite being banned in most of Europe and the United States, gambling is a popular pastime in Russia. slot machines can be found in almost every bar and cafe, while illegal casino dens are common in major cities.</p>
<p>This week, as football fans from around the globe descend on Russia, casino owners and operators are hoping to cash in on the excitement. Dozens of new casinos have been opened in anticipation of the tournament, and many more are expected to spring up over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>The authorities are aware of the potential for illicit activities surrounding the World Cup, and have been cracking down on unlicensed casinos. In Moscow alone, police have closed down 46 illegal gambling venues since May 1st.</p>
<p>But with billions of dollars at stake, it’s unlikely that the casinos will be going anywhere any time soon. The Russian gambling industry is expected to grow by 10% this year, thanks largely to World Cup fever.</p>
