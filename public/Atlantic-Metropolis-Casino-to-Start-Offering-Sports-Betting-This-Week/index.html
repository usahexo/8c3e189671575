Tourists arrive to gamble and take pleasure in other points of interest this week as the casino prepares to offer sports betting.</p>
<p>New Jersey legalized sports betting inside months of the United States Supreme Courtroom ruling in Might that overturned a federal law that experienced banned most forms of sports betting outdoors of Nevada. The Atlantic Metropolis casino is ready to get started this week, despite the fact that some particulars nevertheless have to be worked out.</p>
<p>The casino has been getting ready for this day for a number of months, and it is., president of Boyd Gaming, which operates the casino reported. “We’ve been functioning diligently on this considering that the SCOTUS selection,” he reported.</p>
<p>Boyd Gaming purchased the Revel Casino when it shut down in 2014, and has been transforming it into a resort known as Ocean Resort Casino. The shift into athletics betting is an additional stage in its evolution.</p>

<h1 id="Atlantic-Metropolis-Casino-to-Add-Sports-Betting-Now-That-Supreme-Court-Ruling-Allows-It"><a href="#Atlantic-Metropolis-Casino-to-Add-Sports-Betting-Now-That-Supreme-Court-Ruling-Allows-It" class="headerlink" title="Atlantic Metropolis Casino to Add Sports Betting Now That Supreme Court Ruling Allows It"></a>Atlantic Metropolis Casino to Add Sports Betting Now That Supreme Court Ruling Allows It</h1><p>Casinos in Atlantic City are preparing to offer sports betting, now that the US Supreme Court has struck down a federal law that had banned the activity. The decision opens the door for states to enact their own laws regulating sports betting.</p>
<p>Atlantic Metropolis Casino is among the first in the city to announce its plans to add sports betting. The casino, which is owned by Caesars Entertainment, said it would offer the betting within weeks of the Supreme Court’s ruling.</p>
<p>Other casinos are likely to follow suit. Philadelphia-based SugarHouse Casino has already announced its plans to offer sports betting and has applied for a licence from Pennsylvania gaming regulators.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court’s decision comes as no surprise, given that Justice Anthony Kennedy hinted last year that the law might be overturned. The court’s six conservative justices voted in favour of overturning the ban, while the three liberal justices dissented.</p>
<p>The ban on sports betting was enacted in 1992 as part of the federal law known as the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA). It prevented states from authorising sports gambling, although it did not stop people from engaging in the activity illegally.</p>
<p>Supporters of overturning PASPA argued that it hurt the economy and deprived states of revenue from taxes on gambling. They also said it created an uneven playing field for states that wanted to allow sports betting, because they were prohibited from doing so by federal law.</p>
<p>Opponents of overturning PASPA argued that it would lead to increased crime and addiction rates. They also said it would be difficult to regulate and could jeopardise the integrity of sport games.</p>
<p>Now that PASPA has been overturned, each state will have to decide how to regulate sports betting within its borders. Some states – such as New Jersey, Delaware and West Virginia – have passed laws allowing sports gambling in anticipation of Tuesday’s ruling. Other states are likely to follow suit soon.</p>

<h1 id="Who’s-Next-NJ-Casinos-Poised-to-Offer-Sports-Betting-as-Early-as-This-Week"><a href="#Who’s-Next-NJ-Casinos-Poised-to-Offer-Sports-Betting-as-Early-as-This-Week" class="headerlink" title="Who’s Next? NJ Casinos Poised to Offer Sports Betting as Early as This Week"></a>Who’s Next? NJ Casinos Poised to Offer Sports Betting as Early as This Week</h1><p>_After a long wait and much anticipation, the Garden State is finally ready to offer legalized sports betting. Governor Phil Murphy is expected to sign a bill into law this week that will allow casinos in New Jersey to offer sports betting _</p>
<p>The news comes on the heels of the Supreme Court’s ruling in May that overturned a federal ban on sports betting. Since then, several states have expressed interest in legalizing the activity, but New Jersey has been moving quickly to get ahead of the curve.</p>
<p>According to ESPN, casinos in Atlantic City could start offering sports betting as early as Thursday. There are currently nine casinos in Atlantic City, and all of them are expected to offer sports betting once the new law goes into effect.</p>
<p>The bill allows for both online and in-person sports betting, and it also permits wagers on college games. However, bets on high school games will not be allowed.</p>
<p>“This is the single most important decision that we will make this year,” said Governor Murphy at a recent press conference. “This is about jobs, this is about economic development, this is about making Atlantic City thrive again.”</p>
<p>There’s no question that legalizing sports betting will be a major boon to New Jersey’s economy. In fact, a study by Econsult Solutions found that legalizing sports betting could generate up to $364 million in tax revenue annually. That’s a significant chunk of change that could be used to help bolster New Jersey’s economy.</p>
<p>Not only will states see a financial windfall from legalized sports betting, but they can also expect an increase in tourism dollars. In Las Vegas, which has had legal sports betting for years, visitors spend an average of $500 per trip on gambling-related activities. It’s safe to assume that many of those same people will visit Atlantic City now that it offers legal sports betting as well.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen how much money casinos in New Jersey will make from sports betting, but it’s clear that the activity will be a major boon for the state economy. With Governor Murphy expected to sign the bill into law this week, casinos in Atlantic City are poised to start taking wagers soon thereafter._</p>
