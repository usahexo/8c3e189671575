        <h1 id="Gambling-Mania-Grips-Russia-as-Soccer-Tournament-Approaches"><a href="#Gambling-Mania-Grips-Russia-as-Soccer-Tournament-Approaches" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Mania Grips Russia as Soccer Tournament Approaches"></a>Gambling Mania Grips Russia as Soccer Tournament Approaches</h1><p>A gambling frenzy has gripped Russia in the lead up to the World Cup, as citizens bet all they have on the outcomes of games.</p>
<p>President Vladimir Putin has denounced the trend, but it shows no sign of abating; in fact, it may be intensifying.</p>
<p>Russians are betting on anything and everything – not just the outcomes of soccer matches, but also who will score first, who will get a red card, and so on.</p>
<p>The most popular wagers are on whether or not a goal will be scored within the first five minutes of a game, and whether there will be any red cards shown.</p>
<p>In some cases, people are risking their homes and their livelihoods on World Cup bets.</p>
<p>One businessman has even put his entire company on the line, betting that Russia will win the tournament.</p>
<p>So far, no one has won big in Russia’s World Cup gambling craze; but with the tournament now underway, fortunes could change very quickly.</p>
<h1 id="Russian-Gamblers-Place-Bets-on-World-Cup-Results"><a href="#Russian-Gamblers-Place-Bets-on-World-Cup-Results" class="headerlink" title="Russian Gamblers Place Bets on World Cup Results"></a>Russian Gamblers Place Bets on World Cup Results</h1><p>With the World Cup in full swing, Russian gamblers are placing their bets on the outcomes of the matches. The country’s largest online gambling site, PokerStars, reports that Russians are betting tens of millions of rubles on the cup.</p>
<p>One bettor has put down 300,000 rubles (nearly $5,500) on Germany to win the tournament. Another has wagered 205,000 rubles (nearly $3,700) on Spain. Smaller bets are also being placed, with people wagering as little as 100 rubles (around $1.80) on a particular team.</p>
<p>Russians have always been enthusiastic bettors, but the World Cup has taken things to a new level. Online gambling sites say that Russia is now one of their biggest markets for betting on the cup. In addition to PokerStars, websites such as Fonbet and MarathonBet are seeing a surge in Russian registrations and bets.</p>
<p>Why do Russians love gambling so much? One possible explanation is that many people see it as a way to make easy money. And with so many big bets being placed on the World Cup, it’s no wonder that gambling sites are seeing such a surge in Russian registrations.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason may be, it seems that Russians will be keeping busy over the next few weeks betting on World Cup results. Whether they’re winning or losing money, one thing is for sure – there’s never a dull moment when it comes to Russian gambling!</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Booms-in-Russia-as-Fans-Look-to-Cash-in-on-World-Cup-Fever"><a href="#Gambling-Booms-in-Russia-as-Fans-Look-to-Cash-in-on-World-Cup-Fever" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Booms in Russia as Fans Look to Cash in on World Cup Fever"></a>Gambling Booms in Russia as Fans Look to Cash in on World Cup Fever</h1><p>Russians are flocking to online gambling websites in droves in anticipation of the World Cup, driving a boom in the industry. According to recent figures, Russian punters have wagered a total of 1.2 billion rubles (US$19 million) on sports betting in the first five months of 2018, up by 41 percent from the same period last year.</p>
<p>Much of this betting is being done on the back of the World Cup, with fans looking to make some easy money by backing their home team or other teams they think will do well. The huge influx of cash is providing a much-needed boost to Russia’s gambling industry, which has been in decline since 2009 due to tightened regulation and increasing taxes.</p>
<p>To take advantage of this World Cup-fuelled gambling bonanza, many online casinos are offering promotional bonuses and discounts to players. For example, Casino-X is currently offering new players a 100 percent bonus on their first deposit up to US$1,000. Meanwhile, Vulkan Vegas is giving away free spins and other bonuses worth up to US$1,500.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking for some excitement during the World Cup, why not try your luck at some Russian online casinos? You might just end up winning big!</p>
<h1 id="Russians-Bet-Record-Amounts-on-World-Cup-Matches"><a href="#Russians-Bet-Record-Amounts-on-World-Cup-Matches" class="headerlink" title="Russians Bet Record Amounts on World Cup Matches"></a>Russians Bet Record Amounts on World Cup Matches</h1><p>Russians are betting record amounts on World Cup matches, with one bookmaker reporting a turnover of more than 5 billion rubles ($87 million) in the first week of the tournament.</p>
<p>Firms have been offering customers a range of promotions and betting opportunities as Russia takes on Saudi Arabia in the opening match on Thursday.</p>
<p>President Vladimir Putin has urged Russians to “get behind” their team as they prepare to kick off the month-long competition, which is being hosted in 11 cities across the country.</p>
<p>Paddy Power Betfair, which owns Russian bookmaker Leon, said that customers had staked 5.09 billion rubles by Monday, with about 60 percent of that placed on Sunday’s match between Portugal and Spain.</p>
<p>That was despite Spain winning just 1-0 after extra time, with Paddy Power Betfair saying that most bets were placed before the game started.</p>
<p>“Russians are definitely out in force to back their team,” said spokeswoman Veronika Kuznetsova.</p>
<p>“Despite the overwhelming favorites Spain not managing to win by a convincing margin, punters were still confident they would see off Portugal.” </p>
<p>With just days left before the World Cup kicks off, sports books around Russia are seeing unprecedented action as locals gamble on everything from who will win to how many cards will be shown. President Vladimir Putin has urged Russians to “get behind” their team as they prepare to kick off the month-long competition in 11 cities across the country.</p>
<p>State-owned Sberbank has already issued loans worth 30 billion rubles ($535 million) for citizens wanting to place bets during the World Cup, according to local media. And private firms have been offering customers a range of promotions and betting opportunities as Russia takes on Saudi Arabia in the opening match on Thursday.<br>The outcome of that game is far from certain: oddsmakers give Russia only a 44 percent chance of winning, while Saudi Arabia is given a 17 percent chance, according to ESPN. But that hasn’t kept locals from gambling nonetheless: Alexander Kostitsyn of Russian bookmaker Liga Stavok told The Moscow Times that his firm has taken in 5 billion rubles ($87 million) in wagers so far this World Cup—twice what it took in for the 2014 tournament. Most of that action has come in recent days as excitement builds for Thursday’s match.<br>“People are betting all sorts of things,” Kostitsyn told The Moscow Times. “How many red cards will be shown? What will be Putin’s final score?”</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Takes-Centre-Stage-in-Russia-as-World-Cup-Kicks-Off"><a href="#Gambling-Takes-Centre-Stage-in-Russia-as-World-Cup-Kicks-Off" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Takes Centre Stage in Russia as World Cup Kicks Off"></a>Gambling Takes Centre Stage in Russia as World Cup Kicks Off</h1><p>Moscow, Russia - June 14, 2018: The gambling industry is in the spotlight as the World Cup kicks off in Russia. With an estimated value of $3.3 billion, the Russian gambling market is one of the most lucrative in the world.</p>
<p>Despite being banned in most of Europe and the United States, gambling is a popular pastime in Russia. slot machines can be found in almost every bar and cafe, while illegal casino dens are common in major cities.</p>
<p>This week, as football fans from around the globe descend on Russia, casino owners and operators are hoping to cash in on the excitement. Dozens of new casinos have been opened in anticipation of the tournament, and many more are expected to spring up over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>The authorities are aware of the potential for illicit activities surrounding the World Cup, and have been cracking down on unlicensed casinos. In Moscow alone, police have closed down 46 illegal gambling venues since May 1st.</p>
<p>But with billions of dollars at stake, it’s unlikely that the casinos will be going anywhere any time soon. The Russian gambling industry is expected to grow by 10% this year, thanks largely to World Cup fever.</p>

<ol>
<li>Talk to your loved one about their addiction.</li>

<ol start="3">
<li>Help your loved one stay accountable.</li>
</ol>

In this article, we’re going to teach you how to do it.</p>
<p>To start, you’ll need to find a slot machine that’s not being monitored by the casino. The easiest way to do this is to find a machine in an out-of-the-way area, such as in a corner or at the back of the room. Once you’ve found a machine that meets your needs, you can start hacking it.</p>
<p>The first step is to identify the type of slot machine you’re dealing with. There are three main types: electromechanical slots, video slots, and progressive slots. Electromechanical slots are the oldest type of slot machine and are generally less complicated to hack than the other two types. Video slots are more complex and can be more difficult to hack, while progressive slots are the most difficult type to hack because they involve a network of machines that share the same jackpot.</p>
<p>Once you’ve identified the type of machine you’re dealing with, it’s time to start hacking it. For electromechanical slots, all you need is a small screwdriver or paper clip to reset the machine. For video slots, you may need a computer with special software in order to hack them. Progressive slots are the most difficult to hack because they involve a network of machines that share the same jackpot – however, there are ways to hack them if you know what you’re doing.</p>
<p>Now that you know how to hack online casino slot machines, it’s time for you get out there and start winning!</p>

While the country may be small, it is packed with beautiful scenery and interesting attractions, including the wedding chapel on Funafuti Island. Here are some tips for getting to the chapel.</p>
<p>Funafuti Island is the capital of Tuvalu and home to the country’s only airport. The airport is serviced by Air Tuvalu, which offers flights from Fiji and Honolulu. If you are not able to fly into Funafuti Island, there are also ferry services available from Fiji and Samoa.</p>

<p>The wedding chapel on Funafuti Island is a beautiful white building with a thatched roof. It was built by the Japanese government in 1960 and has been used for weddings ever since. The chapel can accommodate up to 100 guests and has a picturesque location overlooking the ocean.</p>

<h1 id="What-to-Expect-When-Getting-Married-in-Tuvalu"><a href="#What-to-Expect-When-Getting-Married-in-Tuvalu" class="headerlink" title="What to Expect When Getting Married in Tuvalu"></a>What to Expect When Getting Married in Tuvalu</h1><p>When you think of wedding destinations, the paradise-like islands of Tuvalu may not be one of the first places that come to mind. But this cluster of nine islands in the Pacific Ocean has much to offer couples looking to tie the knot.

<li>There is no need for a visa or any other special paperwork for couples getting married in Tuvalu. </li>
<li>Weddings can be held at any time of year, although November to April is considered the best time to get married in Tuvalu due to the cooler weather and lower humidity. </li>
<li>Most weddings in Tuvalu take place on the island of Funafuti, where the majority of the population lives. However, it is also possible to hold weddings on other islands in the cluster. </li>
<li>Marriage ceremonies in Tuvalu are typically quite simple and relaxed, with most couples choosing a brief exchange of vows officiated by a local minister or elder. </li>

<h1 id="How-Much-Does-It-Cost-to-Get-Married-in-Tuvalu"><a href="#How-Much-Does-It-Cost-to-Get-Married-in-Tuvalu" class="headerlink" title="How Much Does It Cost to Get Married in Tuvalu?"></a>How Much Does It Cost to Get Married in Tuvalu?</h1><p>On the surface, it may appear that getting married in Tuvalu would be a relatively inexpensive endeavor. After all, this small island country is located in the South Pacific and is considered to be one of the world’s poorest nations. However, when you consider all of the associated costs, marrying in Tuvalu can be quite expensive.</p>
<p>The first cost you will need to consider is travel. Unless you live in the South Pacific or are able to score a ridiculously cheap airfare, getting to Tuvalu will likely be your biggest expense. Once you’re there, you’ll need to factor in accommodations and food costs. Even if you’re lucky enough to find a place to stay that’s affordable, you’ll still likely spend quite a bit on food since prices for basic staples like rice and fish are high compared to other countries.</p>
<p>Another big expense when getting married in Tuvalu is the marriage license itself. The fee for a marriage license in Tuvalu is currently $200 USD, which is more than what you would pay in most other countries. And don’t forget about gratuities! If you have a wedding planner or any other service providers helping with your wedding ceremony and reception, it’s customary to tip them 10-20% of the total cost.</p>
<p>So how much does it actually cost to get married in Tuvalu? Assuming you’re flying from North America and have a small wedding with just a few guests, we estimate that the total cost would be around $3,500 USD. This includes the cost of the marriage license, travel expenses, food and accommodation costs, and tips for service providers. Keep in mind that this amount could vary significantly depending on your specific circumstances.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for an exotic location to get married but don’t want to break the bank, Tuvalu may be a good option for you. Just be sure to factor in all of the associated costs so that you’re not surprised by anything once you’re there!</p>

However, in some countries like Canada and the United States, the legal age to gamble is 21 years old. This article will explore how old you have to be to gamble in a new casino online blackjack real money.</p>
<p>The legal age to gamble at a casino in Canada is 18 years old. The minimum age requirement to gamble at a casino in the United States is 21 years old. Gambling at a casino is considered an illegal act in some states if you are under the age of 21. There are also some casinos that do not allow anyone under the age of 18 to enter the premises.</p>
<p>When it comes to online gambling, there are no federal laws that set a specific age requirement. This means that each state determines its own gambling laws when it comes to online gambling. In most states, the legal age to gamble online is 21 years old. There are only a few states that allow people as young as 18 years old to gamble online.</p>
<p>Most countries around the world have a legal age of 18 for gambling in casinos. There are a few exceptions, however. In Macau, for instance, the legal age to gamble is 21 years old. And in Greece, the legal age is 23 years old.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-Gambling-Ages-for-Different-Types-of-Casinos"><a href="#What-are-the-Gambling-Ages-for-Different-Types-of-Casinos" class="headerlink" title="What are the Gambling Ages for Different Types of Casinos?"></a>What are the Gambling Ages for Different Types of Casinos?</h1><p>Casinos come in all shapes and sizes. There are casinos that cater to high-rollers, with table games that offer stakes of $1,000 or more. There are also casinos that are geared towards penny slots players, who like their chances of winning small payouts frequently.</p>
<p>No matter what type of casino you’re interested in, though, you need to be aware of the gambling age. This is the age at which you’re legally allowed to gamble in that particular casino.</p>
<p>The gambling age for most Atlantic City casinos is 21. However, there are a few exceptions. The Golden Nugget is the only Atlantic City casino where the gambling age is 18. The Sands Casino Resort Bethlehem has a gambling age of 21, but people under 21 are allowed in the casino if they’re accompanied by an adult.</p>
<p>In Las Vegas, the gambling age is 21 at almost all casinos. There’s one exception: The D Hotel and Casino allows people 18 and older to gamble on its premises.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Nevada, the minimum gambling age is usually 19. However, some casinos have a minimum age of 21.</p>
<p>In Connecticut, the legal gambling age is 18 at tribal casinos and 20 at commercial casinos.</p>
<p>Back in New Jersey, the minimum gambling age at racetracks with casino licenses is 21. However, those under 21 are allowed to bet on races as long as they don’t place any bets on the races themselves.</p>
<p>So, as you can see, there’s no one answer when it comes to the gambling ages for different types of casinos! Be sure to check with the casino itself before heading out to Gamble!</p>
<h1 id="Are-There-Any-Age-Limits-for-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Are-There-Any-Age-Limits-for-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Are There Any Age Limits for Online Gambling?"></a>Are There Any Age Limits for Online Gambling?</h1><p>There are no age limits for online gambling, but there are some age restrictions for gambling in general. Each country sets its own gambling laws, so it’s important to check the legal age to gamble in your country.</p>
<p>In many countries, the legal age to gamble is 18 years old. However, there are some countries where the legal age is 21 years old or older. For example, in the United States, the legal age to gamble is 21 years old.</p>
<p>Some people may think that there is an age limit for online gambling because of the many underage gambling scandals that have made headlines over the years. However, these scandals usually involve people who are illegally accessing online casinos and bingo sites. There are no specific laws against underage gambling on online casino or bingo sites, but operators of these sites are responsible for ensuring that their customers meet the legal age requirement.</p>
<p>So, if you’re over 18 years old, you can legally gamble at any online casino or bingo site. Just make sure you check the website’s terms and conditions to see if there are any restrictions on players from your country.</p>
<h1 id="How-Do-You-Prove-Your-Age-When-Gambling-in-a-Casino"><a href="#How-Do-You-Prove-Your-Age-When-Gambling-in-a-Casino" class="headerlink" title="How Do You Prove Your Age When Gambling in a Casino?"></a>How Do You Prove Your Age When Gambling in a Casino?</h1><p>Casinos are businesses, and as such, they have a vested interest in ensuring that those who gamble in their establishments are of legal age. This is to protect both the casino and the gambler; if someone under the legal age gambles and loses money, the casino can be held liable, but if someone over the legal age gambles and loses money, the casino is not as liable. So, how do casinos verify the ages of their gamblers?</p>
<p>The most common way for casinos to verify age is through photo identification. Most casinos will ask for a driver’s license or another government-issued ID card as proof of age. In some cases, though, a passport may be required instead. If a person does not have a photo ID, then the casino may ask for other forms of identification such as a birth certificate or social security card.</p>
<p>It is important to note that not all casinos require photo identification. Some smaller casinos may simply ask for the customer’s age, and if they are too young, they will not be allowed to gamble. Other casinos may use other methods of verification such as checking the age listed on credit cards or looking up information in public records databases.</p>
<p>No matter what method a casino uses to verify age, it is important that customers bring some form of identification with them when they visit the casino. This will help avoid any potential problems later on.</p>
<h1 id="Can-Underage-Gamblers-Play-in-Land-Based-Casinos"><a href="#Can-Underage-Gamblers-Play-in-Land-Based-Casinos" class="headerlink" title="Can Underage Gamblers Play in Land-Based Casinos?"></a>Can Underage Gamblers Play in Land-Based Casinos?</h1><p>There is no clear answer as to whether underage gamblers are able to participate in casino games at land-based establishments. While the law is not always black and white, it is typically illegal for anyone under the age of 21 to gamble in a casino. There are some exceptions to this rule, but they are few and far between.</p>
<p>So why isn’t it more black and white? The reason for this has to do with interpretation. The law enforcement officials who are responsible for enforcing gambling regulations can interpret the rules in different ways. This often leads to confusion about what is and isn’t allowed.</p>
<h1 id="The-Basics-of-Gambling-Laws"><a href="#The-Basics-of-Gambling-Laws" class="headerlink" title="The Basics of Gambling Laws"></a>The Basics of Gambling Laws</h1><p>Even though there is some ambiguity when it comes to minors and gambling, there are some basics that are well-understood. In most cases, it is illegal for anyone under the age of 21 to gamble in a casino. There are a few exceptions to this rule, such as when someone is playing in a charity or educational gaming event. But by and large, if you’re not yet 21, you’re not supposed to be gambling in a casino setting.</p>
<p>This also includes online casinos. Most major casinos have age verification systems that require players to input their date of birth before they can play any games. This is done to ensure compliance with gambling regulations. If you try to play at an online casino without meeting the required age, you’ll likely be blocked from doing so.</p>
<h1 id="State-Laws-Can-Vary"><a href="#State-Laws-Can-Vary" class="headerlink" title="State Laws Can Vary"></a>State Laws Can Vary</h1><p>While the basic rule regarding minors and gambling is pretty consistent across states, there can be some variance when it comes to specific details. For example, in some states it’s legal for someone 18 or older to gamble in a casino. Other states have lower age limits, such as 19 or 20 years old. So if you’re thinking of travelling to another state in order to gamble at a casino, be sure to check the relevant laws first. You don’t want to find yourself on the wrong side of the law!</p>
<h1 id="Enforcement-Can-Be-Confusing"><a href="#Enforcement-Can-Be-Confusing" class="headerlink" title="Enforcement Can Be Confusing"></a>Enforcement Can Be Confusing</h1><p>As mentioned earlier, there can be some ambiguity when it comes to enforcing gambling regulations regarding minors. This often leads to confusion among both players and operators alike about what is and isn’t allowed. It’s not uncommon for law enforcement officials to crack down on casinos for allowing underage gambling, even if it’s technically legal according to state law. Conversely, sometimes establishments will be allowed to operate even if they’re knowingly allowing minors onto their premises for gambling purposes.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that determining whether or not underage gamblers can play at land-based casinos can be confusing affair - but that doesn’t mean it’s impossible! If you’re unsure about whether or not you’re allowed do participate in casino games, your best bet is speak with an attorney who specializes in gaming law</p>

<h1 id="Atlantic-Metropolis-Casino-to-Add-Sports-Betting-Now-That-Supreme-Court-Ruling-Allows-It"><a href="#Atlantic-Metropolis-Casino-to-Add-Sports-Betting-Now-That-Supreme-Court-Ruling-Allows-It" class="headerlink" title="Atlantic Metropolis Casino to Add Sports Betting Now That Supreme Court Ruling Allows It"></a>Atlantic Metropolis Casino to Add Sports Betting Now That Supreme Court Ruling Allows It</h1><p>Casinos in Atlantic City are preparing to offer sports betting, now that the US Supreme Court has struck down a federal law that had banned the activity. The decision opens the door for states to enact their own laws regulating sports betting.</p>
<p>Atlantic Metropolis Casino is among the first in the city to announce its plans to add sports betting. The casino, which is owned by Caesars Entertainment, said it would offer the betting within weeks of the Supreme Court’s ruling.</p>
<p>Other casinos are likely to follow suit. Philadelphia-based SugarHouse Casino has already announced its plans to offer sports betting and has applied for a licence from Pennsylvania gaming regulators.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court’s decision comes as no surprise, given that Justice Anthony Kennedy hinted last year that the law might be overturned. The court’s six conservative justices voted in favour of overturning the ban, while the three liberal justices dissented.</p>
<p>The ban on sports betting was enacted in 1992 as part of the federal law known as the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA). It prevented states from authorising sports gambling, although it did not stop people from engaging in the activity illegally.</p>
<p>Supporters of overturning PASPA argued that it hurt the economy and deprived states of revenue from taxes on gambling. They also said it created an uneven playing field for states that wanted to allow sports betting, because they were prohibited from doing so by federal law.</p>
<p>Opponents of overturning PASPA argued that it would lead to increased crime and addiction rates. They also said it would be difficult to regulate and could jeopardise the integrity of sport games.</p>
<p>Now that PASPA has been overturned, each state will have to decide how to regulate sports betting within its borders. Some states – such as New Jersey, Delaware and West Virginia – have passed laws allowing sports gambling in anticipation of Tuesday’s ruling. Other states are likely to follow suit soon.</p>

<h1 id="Who’s-Next-NJ-Casinos-Poised-to-Offer-Sports-Betting-as-Early-as-This-Week"><a href="#Who’s-Next-NJ-Casinos-Poised-to-Offer-Sports-Betting-as-Early-as-This-Week" class="headerlink" title="Who’s Next? NJ Casinos Poised to Offer Sports Betting as Early as This Week"></a>Who’s Next? NJ Casinos Poised to Offer Sports Betting as Early as This Week</h1><p>_After a long wait and much anticipation, the Garden State is finally ready to offer legalized sports betting. Governor Phil Murphy is expected to sign a bill into law this week that will allow casinos in New Jersey to offer sports betting _</p>
<p>The news comes on the heels of the Supreme Court’s ruling in May that overturned a federal ban on sports betting. Since then, several states have expressed interest in legalizing the activity, but New Jersey has been moving quickly to get ahead of the curve.</p>
<p>According to ESPN, casinos in Atlantic City could start offering sports betting as early as Thursday. There are currently nine casinos in Atlantic City, and all of them are expected to offer sports betting once the new law goes into effect.</p>
<p>The bill allows for both online and in-person sports betting, and it also permits wagers on college games. However, bets on high school games will not be allowed.</p>
<p>“This is the single most important decision that we will make this year,” said Governor Murphy at a recent press conference. “This is about jobs, this is about economic development, this is about making Atlantic City thrive again.”</p>
<p>There’s no question that legalizing sports betting will be a major boon to New Jersey’s economy. In fact, a study by Econsult Solutions found that legalizing sports betting could generate up to $364 million in tax revenue annually. That’s a significant chunk of change that could be used to help bolster New Jersey’s economy.</p>
<p>Not only will states see a financial windfall from legalized sports betting, but they can also expect an increase in tourism dollars. In Las Vegas, which has had legal sports betting for years, visitors spend an average of $500 per trip on gambling-related activities. It’s safe to assume that many of those same people will visit Atlantic City now that it offers legal sports betting as well.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen how much money casinos in New Jersey will make from sports betting, but it’s clear that the activity will be a major boon for the state economy. With Governor Murphy expected to sign the bill into law this week, casinos in Atlantic City are poised to start taking wagers soon thereafter._</p>
